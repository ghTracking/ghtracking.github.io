## What is the principle of a priori probabilities?
Systeme equally likely to be found in any of its states. 

## What is the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation?

$$\left(\frac{\partial (G/T)}{\partial T}\right)_P = -\frac{H}{T^2}$$


## Fluctuations
Expand S in Taylor series about E$^*$ (most likely energy)

OR

differentiate average w.r.t $\beta$ using partition function.

## How do we conclude that Helmholtz energy is minimum at eqm?
Consider total states consisting of system and bath (which is a product of $\Omega$).

Condition for eqm is that derivative of ln $\Omega$ w.r.t. $E_s$ vanishes. Following this, we can identify entropy in the equation and see that $\beta(E_{sys} - TS_{sys})$ must be minimised.

## Why can we not compute thermal averages in practice?
Cannot solve many-body Hamiltonian. 
Numerical evaluation would not be reasonable, given the number of states.

## Derive the expression for the pressure of interacting particles and with pairwise additive forces.


## What is the law of corresponding states?


## Show that temperatures, pressures and chemical potentials must be equal at eqm.
dS$_1$ +dS$_2$ = 0 


## Provide the thermodynamic arguments to find the stability of a single phase. 
Consider variation of entropy to 2nd order.

$$\Delta S = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial(1/T)}{\partial E}(\Delta E)^2\right)_1 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial(1/T)}{\partial E}(\Delta E)^2\right)_2$$

S is maximum, so $\Delta S$ must be less than or equal to zero. 

Can do a similar trick with Helmholtz energy

$$\Delta A = \frac{\partial^2A}{\partial V^2} (\Delta V)^2\\\\
 =- \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} (\Delta V)^2\\
= \frac{1}{\kappa V} (\Delta V)^2
$$
A is minimised, so $\kappa \geq 0$.


## Describe the conditions for coexistence. 
Plotting Helmholtz energy against volume, there must be a common tangent between two points (which implies pressures equal. It then follows that chemical potentials are equal also).

Positions are unstable if $\frac{\partial^2 A}{\partial V^2} \leq 0$. That is, the lineshape is concave.  


## What is the spinodal?
The boundary between the stable and metastable regions for phases.

### What is the Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality? Why is it important ? Derive it.

### What is the Green-Kubo relation? Why is it important? Derive it. 


### What is the random walk? Why is it important? Derive it. 



### What is the velocity auto-correlation function? Why is it important? Derive it.

The velocity auto-correlation function is an equilibrium property of the system. It describes velocities at different times along the eqm trajectory.\
    -> Equilibrium properties are time invariant, meaning the time-correlation function can be shifted by an arbitrary amount $\tau$.
