## What is the principle of a priori probabilities?
Systeme equally likely to be found in any of its states. 

## What is the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation?

$$\left(\frac{\partial (G/T)}{\partial T}\right)_P = -\frac{H}{T^2}$$


## Fluctuations
Expand S in Taylor series about E$$^*$$ (most likely energy)

OR

differentiate average w.r.t $$\beta$$ using partition function.

## How do we conclude that Helmholtz energy is minimum at eqm?
Consider total states consisting of system and bath (which is a product of $$\Omega$$).

Condition for eqm is that derivative of ln $$\Omega$$ w.r.t. $$E_s$$ vanishes. Following this, we can identify entropy in the equation and see that $$\beta(E_{sys} - TS_{sys})$$ must be minimised.

## Why can we not compute thermal averages in practice?
Cannot solve many-body Hamiltonian. 
Numerical evaluation would not be reasonable, given the number of states.

## Derive the expression for the pressure of interacting particles and with pairwise additive forces.


## What is the law of corresponding states?


## Show that temperatures, pressures and chemical potentials must be equal at eqm.
dS$$_1$$ +dS$$_2$$ = 0 


## Provide the thermodynamic arguments to find the stability of a single phase. 
Consider variation of entropy to 2nd order.

$$\Delta S = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial(1/T)}{\partial E}(\Delta E)^2\right)_1 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial(1/T)}{\partial E}(\Delta E)^2\right)_2$$

S is maximum, so $$\Delta S$$ must be less than or equal to zero. 

Can do a similar trick with Helmholtz energy

$$\Delta A = \frac{\partial^2A}{\partial V^2} (\Delta V)^2\\\\
 =- \frac{\partial P}{\partial V} (\Delta V)^2\\
= \frac{1}{\kappa V} (\Delta V)^2
$$
A is minimised, so $$\kappa \geq 0$$.


## Describe the conditions for coexistence. 
Plotting Helmholtz energy against volume, there must be a common tangent between two points (which implies pressures equal. It then follows that chemical potentials are equal also).

Positions are unstable if $$\frac{\partial^2 A}{\partial V^2} \leq 0$$. That is, the lineshape is concave.  


## What is the spinodal?
The boundary between the stable and metastable regions for phases.


## Why do we require pertubation theory?
To arrive at estimates for quantities which are not mechanical averages, such as the free energy. Relies on knowing a reference system.

### What is the Gibbs-Bogoliubov inequality? Why is it important ? Derive it.
Compute deriative of free energy with respect to $$\lambda$$.

$$\left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial\lambda}_{N,V,T} = \left\langle\frac{\partial U}{\partial \lambda}_{\lambda} \right\rangle \right)$$

Second derivative is always non-positive, which suggests that the derivative at $$\lambda$$ = 0 is greater than subsequent values. 

Hence, the perturbation theory estimate is always an upper bound.

Best results when fluctuations of $$U_1-U_0$$ are small. 

## Mean field theory and Ising model


## Describe the significance van der Waals equation.
Fluctuation of Gibbs-Bogoliubov can be made to disappear by taking form of potential as repulsive core and mild attraction over significant distance beyond this.

## By how much does the addition of a hard sphere reduce the volume available?
$$\frac{4\pi\sigma^3}{3}$$, where $$\sigma$$ is the diameter.

### What is the Green-Kubo relation? Why is it important? Derive it. 


### What is the random walk? Why is it important? Derive it. 



### What is the velocity auto-correlation function? Why is it important? Derive it.

The velocity auto-correlation function is an equilibrium property of the system. It describes velocities at different times along the eqm trajectory.\
    -> Equilibrium properties are time invariant, meaning the time-correlation function can be shifted by an arbitrary amount $$\tau$$.
