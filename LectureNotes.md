## 1. Inside the Earth <a name="1"></a> 
[Back to top](#top)

* The temperature increase with depth is approximately 25<sup>o</sup> km<sup>-1</sup> away from tectonic plate boundaries.
* p-waves
     * Longitudinal motion
     * Faster than s-waves
     * Shadow zone between 103 and 142<sup>o</sup>.
     * Approximately 250km from their source, p-waves arrive earlier than expected as they travel along the Mohorovicic Discontinuity (~30km below continental crust, ~8km below oceanic), which permits a greater velocity of 8km s<sup>-1</sup> compared to 6km s<sup>-1</sup> otherwise.
* s-waves
     * Transverse motion
     * Known that they are able to pass through the inner core due to the existence of PKJKP waves, which reflect a mode of shear wave propagation through the inner core.
* The Preliminary Earth Reference Model is a formulation developed in the 1980s which assumes that the interior of the Earth is radially symmetric, allowing seismic velocities to be deduced. Hence, without deep excavation, elastic properties and densities of materials can be obtained, providing a greater understanding of Earth's composition.
* Seismic attenuation is dependent on the temperature of the surrounding material, as well as a possible magma's content and composition. Therefore, it is able to serve as a good indicator of structure, provided that the dissipation of energy by frictional means or generally spreading over a larger area does not significantly affect the results.

## 2. Geological time <a name="2"></a> 
[Back to top](#top)

The closure temperature of a mineral is the temperature at which an isotope decay system is determined to be closed, meaning there is no loss of daughter atom material. This allows for valid dating to take place. In Zircon, the U-Pb temperature is approximately 750<sup>o</sup>C, whereas the corresponding value for K-Ar in biotite is 300<sup>o</sup>C. 
* Four primary laws for deducing rock facies
     * Principle of initial horizontality

          * Ooids - shallow, turbulent, high energy environment
     * Upper Estuarine Series (Rutland Formation)
          * Shales/silts - paludal
     * Unconformity from Jurassic to Quaternary
     * Glacial sediments (boulder-clay, gravel)

* *For greater detail of Milankovitch cycles and foraminifera as indicators, see climate lecture series*
* One species of foram coils to right in ice-free waters
* Seawater enriched in <sup>16</sup>O when permanent ice caps exist - preserved in foram fossils
* The eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1990 caused a global temperature decrease of 0.5<sup>o</sup>C. Similarly, the eruption of Krakatau in 1883 led to significant atmospheric changes, most notably in the increase of SO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. Consequently, cloud albedo increased and temperature reduced. Evidence for substantial atmospheric alteration is evidenced from the expressive artwork of the period.
* Occurring 25 times during the last glacial period, Dansgaard-Oeschger Events are short-scale rapid warming events. Some have suggested that these occurrences feature some quasi-periodicity; this is perhaps reconciled by considering the effect on ocean water currents and their tendency to instigate long-term feedback processes.

## 4. Deforming the Earth (more to add)<a name="4"></a> 
[Back to top](#top)

* Crust/mantle in terminology - compositional
* Lithosphere/asthenosphere in terminology - mechanical
* Gobi-Altay Fault offset (1957) - 3.5m
* San Andreas Fault offset (1857) - 8.5m
* At low stress and high homologous temperature, diffusion creep occurs. This may be Nabarro-Herring or Coble.  ε rate = Aσ<sup>n</sup>, where n=1.
* Rheological tests performed by Karato (1986) suggested that dislocation creep follows a power law with n ≈ 3
* The viscosity of the mantle may be predicted by measurements of post-glacial rebound. This is achieved by measuring rates of isostatic response at the Gulf of Bothania, Scandinavia. A rate of 10 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> leads to estimates of 10<sup>20</sup>Pa s.

Fantozzi, G., Chevalier, J., Olagnon, C. and Chermant, J.L., 2000. Creep of ceramic matrix composites.

## 5. Gravity, Isostasy and Paleomagnetism(more to add) <a name="5"></a> 
[Back to top](#top)

* The geoid is the equipotential gravity surface that extends and undulates across the surface of the Earth. It corresponds to sea surface. Importantly, long-wavelength observations differ from theoretical calculations by less than 100m, meaning anomalies reflect activity at depth. 
* Apparent Polar Wander Paths of Europe and North America converge in Silurian time and appear to diverge in the Jurassic Period
     * However, this correlation is only achieved when plotting the continental edges
     * The use of selective evidence caused many to initially doubt Wegener's ideas of continental drift. Paleomagnetism strengthened and supported the theory of plate tectonics as a result of evidence for magnetic reversals in seafloor suites
* Paleomagnetism
     * Chemo-remanent
          * Magnetisation acquired by iron oxides through phase changes at low temperature. Believed to be the magnetic origin of 'red beds' - Haematite in New Red Sandstone of Arran
     * Thermo-remanent
          * Cooling of mineral through Curie point (e.g. 500<sup>o</sup>C in magnetite)
     * Detrital-remanent
          * Directionality of field preserved by deposition of sediment.
     * tan I = 2 tan λ

## 6. Secrets of the oceans <a name="6"></a> 
[Back to top](#top)

* One of the fundamental differences between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise is that the former exhibits a median valley, whereas the latter does not. These bathymetric differences are likely to be due to the fact that the East Pacific Rise is a faster spreading ridge (200mm<sup>-1</sup> compared to 25mm<sup>-1</sup>), meaning the graben feature is not permitted to form.

## 8. Lithosphere and asthenosphere<a name="8"></a> 
[Back to top](#top)

* Asthenospheric transition tends to take place at a homologous temperature of 0.85.
* Observed heat flow is lower at a MOR as it occurs by hydrothermal convective circulation, rather than conduction.
* Potential temperature is the temperature that would be observed at the Earth's surface if the adiabatic gradient from the mantle were extracted up along the same line and followed accordingly. 
* d = 2500 + 350 √(t), provided that the age is less than 70 Ma and the depth is less than 5000m.
     * Assumed that material originates from an infinite depth at x=0
     * The plate cooling model deems that isotherms eventually become horizontal, which is also reflected in the constancy of water depth.
* Adiabatic decompression melting occurs when the adiabat intersects the solidus and partial melting occurs. Flux melting is similar to this process, but the inclusion of water means that the solidus temperature is lowered and therefore melting occurs more readily.

* *Why is it possible that more soft-bodied organisms existed in the Proterozoic eon?*
* *What are stromatolites?*
* *Illustrate the process of stromatolite formation.*
* Key: apparent parsimony of cyanobacterial evolution prior to the 'snowball Earth'
* Huronian glaciation
* Kopp et al (2005): cyanobacterial growth models from expected ocean flux of crucial elements such as carbon and iron have suggested that a hegemony of these organisms may have removed a significant amount of methane from the atmosphere. The loss of this greenhouse gas and the rise of oxygen would have permitted temperatures to plummet, leading to the stages of Huronian glaciation and the subsequent 'snowball Earth'. 
  * Perhaps there was an emergence of oxygenic photosynthesisers, before their presence resulted in the aforementioned glaciation. Following the melting of glaciers, influx of sediments essential to life into the oceans may have caused a subsequent cyanobacterial explosion and the capacity for development and evolution of life. It is likely to be no coincidence that the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations of the Cryogenian directly predate the emergence of Ediacaran biota such as Dickinsonia.

* More data: Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)
* Could invoke ideas of Lovelock: net radiation appears to be almost at a balance. Perhaps the idea of a self-regulating, autopoietic system extends from microscopic observations to large scale analyses. "Optimising" vs "influential" Gaia.
  * Has now evolved into field of Earth Science which aims to source the nature of homeostasis mechanisms of the Earth. e.g. evidence of Zeebe and Caldeira (2008) regarding the nature of biological rock weathering to influence climate.
  * At greater than 20 degrees latitude, the atmosphere is the dominant factor in transport of heat away from the equator. Close to the equator, ocean circulation plays a greater role. 
  * The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) forms the ascending limb of the Hadley cell. Further cells exist at latitudes at a greater distance from the equator. Namely, these are the Ferrel and Polar cells.
  * Complexity in understanding of jet streams and general circulation as a conseqiuence of factors such as frontogenesis.
  * Clockwise gyres in the Northern hemisphere and anticlockwise gyres in the Southern hemisphere arise as a consequence of the forces from winds due to the Coriolis force.

  * Alkali-dolerite sills near Prestwick-Mauchline
    * On Mull, regional swarm dykes are tholeiitic
    * Fossil coleoptera (beetles) used as proxies for climatic changes in glaciation periods (Coope 1971)
  * Vegetation colonised surface at end of Devensian due to climatic amelioration and subsequent retreat of ice sheet
  * Raised coastlines are characteristic due to eustatic changes due to ice sheet formation; isostatic uplift followed melting.
  
* Tertiary volcanic districts
  * Intense igneous activity towards beginning of Tertiary
  * Denudation and planation has exposed plutonic features
  * Presence of epidote and quartz veins indicates vapour action
  * Schists almost completely surround the granitic Northern region
  * *Quartz dolerite-suite* <br>
    * Drumadoon Point
    * Bennan Head
    * Kilpatrick Point
  * Southern faults of the Northern granite may be a part of the Highland Boundary Fault.
    * Reminder: Harte (1984) sugested that the HBC could not easily be brought into contact with the underlying Nappes of the Dalradian successions. Periodic uplift in combination with a strike-slip regime could have possibly taken place in the late Ordovician.

  * Basement terranes from North to South
    * Hebridean
    * Central Highlands (Grampian)
    * Midland Valley
    * Central- Southern Uplands
    * IAPETUS SUTURE
    * Leinster - Lakesman
    * (Monian composite)
    * Cornubian
    * North Armorican Composite
  
* Accretion of exotic terranes to North-West America:
  * Deep-marine sediments
  * Volcanic arcs
  * Sliding continental crust
  * Oceanic crust
  
* The base of the Silurian can be observed at Dobb's Linn. Key to this stratigraphy is the identification of Ordovician graptolite species in the Moffat Shale Series.

* The Cadomian belt is likely to have been an active plate margin, with features of a subduction zone emerging in its geological appearance. However, this has not been studied as extensively as other orogenic events in Britain. It may be better observed in the Bohemian Massif within mainland Europe.

* Caledonian (Ordovician to Devonian)
  * Grampian - Scandian - Shelvian - Acadian
  
* Variscan (Carboniferous)

* Boscastle Cornwall displays Variscan folds, whereas Widemouth shows marginal folds. The forelands are observed further North, in the Peak District.
