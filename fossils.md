PHYLUM BRACHIOPODA
* Brachiopods are filter feeders
* Stratigraphy of mid Paleozoic
* Inarticulates (chitinophosphatic shell) such as lingula less useful stratigraphically
  * Some have persisted since Early Cambrian
* Bilaterally symmetrical - bisects valves
* Shallow marine

PHYLUM BRYOZOA
* Colonial marine invertebrates
* Cystid - skeleton of the individual zooid
* USES? Not very useful stratigraphically due to their wide-ranging timescale. Paleoecological?
* O'Dea and Okamura (1999) found that larger zooids were produced in winter months

PHYLUM MOLLUSCA <br>
CLASS CEPHALOPDA<br>
Stratigraphy:
  * Nautiloid - Cambrian
  * Goniatite - Devonian
  * Ceratite - Permian
  * Ammonite - Jurassic
* Maintain buoyancy through siphuncle
  
PHYLUM CNIDARIA<br>
CLASS ANTHOZOA<br>
Corals<br>
Four main orders (three important):<br>
* Rugosa - Cambrian to Triassic
  * Horn-shaped
  * Epithecae show changes in Earth's rate of rotation
* Tabulata - Cambrian to Permian
  * Always colonial
* Scleractinia - Triassic to now
  * The important reef builders
* Paleoecological indicators

PHYLUM ECHINODERMATA <br>
CLASS CRINOIDEA
* Pentameral symmetry
* Porous mesodermal calcite skeleton
* Cup = theca; consists of calyx: thick, lower plates; tegmen: upper, flexible roof
* (Of four orders,) Two orders extinct in Perman, one in triassic

PHYLUM MOLLUSCA<br>
CLASS GASTROPODA
* Head, foot, viscera
* Radula allows for vegetation to be cut (herbivore)
* Cannot find fossil opercula (plate which closes shell)
* Slow evolution
* Microevolutionary sequences supported punctuated equilibrium
  * Evolution by allopatric speciation

PHYLUM HEMICHORDATA<br>
CLASS PTEROBRANCHIA <br>
SUBCLASS GRAPTOLITHINA
* Orders: dendroidea (benthic), graptoloidea (planktic)
* Stratigraphy of lower Paleozoic shales
* Morphology gives some insight into mode of life
* Organic (scleroproteinaceous) skeleton
* Early Cambrian to Late Carboniferous

PHYLUM MOLLUSCA<br>
CLASS BIVALVIA
* Calcite vs aragonite shell
* Non-marine species used to zone Upper Carboniferous
* Facies fossil for marine, brackish, freshwater
* Initially marine, shallow burrowers
  * Freshwater migration, epifaunal activity and burrowing emerged later
  
PHYLUM ARTHROPODA <br>
CLASS TRILOBITA
* Permian extinction
* Cruziana trace fossil
* Calcite exoskeleton
* Grow by ecdysis/moulting
* Middle Ordovician - coaptative structures (skeleton can interlock)
* Stratigraphy of Middle Cambrian

Plants
Gray (1977) suggested that a land flora existed prior to evidence of megafossils of the Late Silurian of more advanced vascular organisms. An 'evolutionary gap' seems to appear the phylogeny of such successions, although the presence of trilete spores seems to suggest that earlier development occurred than has been able to be so far observed. The primary basal lineages may have extended 100 Ma further into the past. Waters et al (1992) indicated that liverworts may have formed this lineage, with mosses, hornworts and vascular plants forming the later descendants. Karol et al (2010) investigated into several unexamined lineages to posit that hornworts and vascular plants may have been sisters as part of the monophyletic bryophyte group.
