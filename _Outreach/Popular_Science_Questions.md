> If you were an element, which element would you be?
- Oxygen: it helps all humans to live!

> What is the most interesting element?
- The metal iridium is named after _Iris_, the Greek Goddess of the rainbow. Its name is explained by the many colours that its salts form! Iridium most likely came from a meteor strike 66 million years ago - this also made all of the land dinosaurs extinct! Iridium is also incredibly corrosion-resistant and has many applications, such as in spark plugs for cars and in catalysts for industry. Iridium has the second-highest density of all of the elements.
