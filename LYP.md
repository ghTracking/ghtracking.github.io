* Spitsbergen sedimentary rocks are 600-800 million years old.
* Akademikerbreen Group
  * Black chert nodules provide evidence for microfossils
  * Carbonates display wavy laminations representative of stromatolites
  
Aside : Rhynie Chert
  * 400 Ma sinter deposit
  * Preserves plants in situ and often in growth position
  * Provides evidence for phylogenic adaptations with regard to osmotic and chemical pressures, as well as the extent to which some of these sporophytic plants were endemic.

* Organic matter in photosynthetic organisms contains less $^{13}C$ in comparison with surrounding sediments, causing fractionation and known as the kinetic isotope effect.
* Similarly, biological sulfate reduction shows a preference for $^{32}S$. Consequently, the sedimentary record may show a greater abundance of this isotope. This is due to the fact that the sulfate atoms are converted to hydrogen sulfide, which then reacts to form pyrite and enters the sedimentary record.

Rocks from Akilia Island show fractionation of carbon isotopes. However, this evidence, as well as the presence of phosphate grains, is determined by some to be the product of metamorphism. Metamorphic activity may therefore act as a great impedance towards our understanding of biological origins. Consequently, many key results relating to similar observations are perhaps in turmoil. Hope is provided by analyses of Minik Rosing, who states that even if the presence of carbon isotopic fractionation is not the original feature of a rock, it has arisen as a result of processes which act upon organic materials.

* The 2 billion-year-old Gunflint Formation holds fossil evidence of bacterial life forms in chert. These lived in an iron-rich marine environment
* Biomarker evidence has been discovered in shales in proximity to North Pole, northwestern Australia. The presence of 2-methylhopane highlights evidence for biological processes and more importantly, dated Archean origins of cyanobacteria. Similarly, steranes also exist within these rocks, suggesting that they once formed constituents of membrane-stiffening compounds. 

Banded Iron Formations persisted until around 1.8 Ga
