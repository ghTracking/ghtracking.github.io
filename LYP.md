* Spitsbergen sedimentary rocks are 600-800 million years old.
* Akademikerbreen Group
  * Black chert nodules provide evidence for microfossils
  * Carbonates display wavy laminations representative of stromatolites
  
Aside : Rhynie Chert
  * 400 Ma sinter deposit
  * Preserves plants in situ and often in growth position
  * Provides evidence for phylogenic adaptations with regard to osmotic and chemical pressures, as well as the extent to which some of these sporophytic plants were endemic.

* Organic matter in photosynthetic organisms contains less <sub>13</sub> in comparison with surrounding sediments, causing fractionation and known as the kinetic isotope effect.
* Similarly, biological sulfate reduction shows a preference for <sub>32</sub>. Consequently, the sedimentary record may show a greater abundance of this isotope. This is due to the fact that the sulfate molecules are converted to hydrogen sulfide, which then reacts to form pyrite and enters the sedimentary record.

Rocks from Akilia Island show fractionation of carbon isotopes. However, this evidence, as well as the presence of phosphate grains, is determined by some to be the product of metamorphism. Metamorphic activity may therefore act as a great impedance towards our understanding of biological origins. Consequently, many key results relating to similar observations are perhaps in turmoil. Hope is provided by analyses of Minik Rosing, who states that even if the presence of carbon isotopic fractionation is not the original feature of a rock, it has arisen as a result of processes which act upon organic materials.

## Chapter 5 The Emergence of Life

## Chapter 6 The Oxygen Revolution
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
* The 2 billion-year-old Gunflint Formation holds fossil evidence of bacterial life forms in chert. These lived in an iron-rich marine environment
* Biomarker evidence has been discovered in shales in proximity to North Pole, northwestern Australia. The presence of 2-methylhopane highlights evidence for biological processes and more importantly, dated Archean origins of cyanobacteria. Similarly, steranes also exist within these rocks, suggesting that they once formed constituents of membrane-stiffening compounds. 

Banded Iron Formations persisted until around 1.8 Ga; red beds appeared 2.2 Ga. The occurrence of pyrite, siderite and uraninite is only found prominently in rocks older than 2.2 Ga.

In an oxygen-rich environment, weathered iron is converted immediately back to oxides, therefore remaining in place. Conversely, such evidence may only be indicative of local environments, and requires further evidence such as the presence of steranes to support the isolation of oxygen in a given time period. To add further complication, the existence of steranes may only only reflect the local environment, rather than the entire planet as a whole. 

Unusual chemical signatures found in Precambrian beds suggest that further mechanisms in addition to photosynthesis are required to create significant amounts of fractionation. These are believed to originate from the prominence of methanogens, whose contributions to fractionation eliminate the discrepancy. Values of <sup>13</sup>C rose to levels of approximately 40 parts per thousand. On the other hand, the dominance of methanogens declines through the lower Proterozoic. The limited amount of sulfur fractionation in the Archean Eon and its emergence in the Lower Proterozoic suggest that oxygen levels must have risen in order to increase the abundance of sulfate in seawater.

One possible route for the emergence of oxygen involves the impact of methane releaed by bacteria from deep marine environments. By the time of the late Archean, these gases would have reached the top of the atmosphere. Following this, the methane would have been photolysed to form H<sub>2</sub>. The molecular weight of this gas allows it to attain the escape velocity to leave the atmosphere. Its greater absence from the mixture of gases on Earth may have allowed an oxygenic environment to have developed more easily. With the coincidence of the decline of volcanic activity, the number of oxygen-consuming gases would have also decreased. The NASA Ames Research Center has attempted to describe the significance and order of each of these events which relieved the 'oxygen brake', but to no current general consensus. Limestones and dolomites also provide evidence to support the fact that the organic burial occurred at a greater rate during this time period. Absolute values of carbon present in the sedimentary record are significantly higher, suggesting that oxygen should have increased in the oceans as a result of this. Apparent subsequent recessions in the quantity of oxygen are most likely to be due to the fact that the atoms contributed to the formation of sulfate ions within the water.

## Chapter 7 The Cyanobacteria, Life's Microbial Heroes
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
* Great Wall (Bil'yakh Group) - 1.5 Ga fossils preserved in chert

Cell differentiation is a difficult feat to accomplish and observe in cyanobacteria. The presence of archaeoellipsoides leads us to believe that evolutionary diversification must have occurred earlier than 1.5 Ga, as observed from molecular phylogenies. Furthermore, eoentophysalis resembles the modern entophysalis extremely closely, suggesting that only minimal further changes must have occurred from 1.5 Ga to the present day in this life form, once again implying that major diversification and evolutionary changes took place in cyanobacteria earlier in time. Nevertheless, these genera are likely to have undergone inherent nucleotide sequence changes over time. 

There is also further suggestion that convergence of species as a result of physiology changes are affected by the environment. Filamentous and unicellular forms appeared to have evolved within the same scope as the cyanobacteria, 2.1 Ga.

Unlike the successions of Spitsbergen, the Bil'yakh Group does not appear to contain fossils such as polybessurus. One may impart that absence of evidence is not evidence for absence, but there are several ways to deduce that the environment of deposition was different, despite the great similarities between the groups. Perhaps most notably, stromatolite structures display variations in microfabric. This is due to the fact that modes of carbonate deposition varied, which also therefore reflects changes in seawater chemistry. The Great Wall features vertical tufts of blue-green filaments, showing that they were stiffened by calcium carbonate before burial in the tidal flats. Thus, Proterozoic stromatolites serve as environmental dipsticks for O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> seawater levels. 

Wright (1932) - adaptive landscape: cyanobacterial stasis arises as a consequence of the fact that the adapative capability of the organism has a diminishingly small probability of improving the performance of the organism.

## Chapter 11 Cambrian Redux
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

* Sponges diverged in the late Proterozoic
* Archaeocyathans (carbonate-secreting sponges) were diverse across Cambrian oceans but died out within 20 million years. *sic transit gloria mundi
* Cnidaria more complex than sponges as extracellular proteins bind cells to create sheets and divide the body into discrete tissues
* The diversification of animal lineages through phylogenic branching is significantly different to branching within lineages
* Crown vs stem groups
* Burgess Shale highlights persistence of stem group animals, as well as emergence of crown groups.
* Exploring molecular clock data and predictions, Wray (1996) inferred evolutionary divergence in genetic sequences. Although this form of technique introduces various uncertainties and inaccuracies, all variations appear to predict that animal evolution occurred earlier than expected.
