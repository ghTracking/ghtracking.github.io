*Still need to expand these notes*
  * Add tables as shown in exam papers (e.g. stratigraphic use)
  * General sketches of morphology
  * Euryhaline vs stenohaline


### Trilobita (class)
* Permian extinction
* Stratigraphy of Middle Cambrian
* Calcite exoskeleton
* Grow by ecdysis/moulting
* Formed coaptative structures in Middle Ordovician (skeleton able to interlock)
* Paleogeographical reconstruction

### Graptolithina (subclass)
* Found in Lower Paleozoic black shales
* Used for biostratigraphy
* Varying functional morphology - orientation provides some indication of mode of life
* Organic (scleroproteinaceous) skeleton
* Early Cambrian to Late Carboniferous
* Dendroidea - benthic; graptoloidea - planktic

### Echinodermata (phylum)
* Pentameral symmetry 
* Mesodermal skeleton from porous calcite plate

### Echinoidea (class)
* Rigid, robust endoskeleton
* Shallow marine
* Exhibited sudden divergence into burrowers during Jurassic
* Evolution displayed elongation and flattening of test, shifting of anus posteriorly, decrease in spine size.

Significance of End-Permian mass extinction - transition of benthos from filter-feeding brachiopods to deposit feeding bivalves
Attached to hard substrate (seen in modern forms): plenipedunculate
Soft substrate: rhizopedunculate

### Bivalvia (class)
* Initially marine, shallow burrowers
  * freshwater migration, epifaunal activity and burrowing emerged later
* Good facies fossils (WHY?)
* Non-marine species used to zone Upper Carboniferous

### Gastropoda (class)
* Microevolutionary sequences support punctuated equilibrium
  * Evolution by allopatric speciation
* High energy environment : low-spired and thick shell

### Corals
* Epithecae (layer of calc. carb.) suggest that Earth's rate of rotation is decreasing (400 days in a year in Devonian)
