# Electrochemistry

## Why is electrochemistry important in analytical studies?

- Analyse a solution for the presence of metal ions.
- Investigate the redox behaviour of different species.
- Electrosynthesis.
- Generation of radicals or unstable ions for further analytic or spectroscopic investigation.


## What is the open-circuit potential (OCV)?

The OCV is the measured potentiala cross two electrodes when no current flows. An OCV cannot be defined when a redox couole cannot be defined.



If an electrode is made to be more negative, the energy level of the electrons increases. An electron is then likely to be lost to an MO of the electrolyte, meaning oxidation of the electrode takes place.

Bard and Faulkner. If the direction of electron flow is from the electrode to protons in solution, this is a _cathodic_ current flow.

## What is an ideal polarised electrode?

An electrode at which only non-Faradaic processes take place. That is, there are no current-inducing charge-transfer reactions by the bulk solution. No real electrode can behave like this over an entire potential range, but some electrodes demonstrate this behaviour over large potential ranges. 

## Describe the arrangement of the solution close to an electrode interface.

The structure overall close the the electrode is known as the _double layer_ and features oriented dipoles and ions of the solution. The inner layer is known as the Stern or Helmholtz layer, consisting of _inner_ and _outer_ Helmholtz planes. Beyond this is the diffuse layer, whose thickness varies depending on the concentration of the electrolyte.

## Describe the different ways in which charging can take place in a capacitive system.

- Potential step
  -    Current has initial increase before decreasing exponentially.
- Constant current
    - Potential increases linearly with time.
- Voltage ramp
    - Current rises from zero with decreasing gradient and reaches constant value. 


## What is overpotential? 

Potential applied/potential under working conditions minus the electrode potential. 



Slower sweep rate makes a process more irreversible. Faster sweep rate increases current, as the species to be reduces is used up more rapidly, leading to a more significant concentration gradient. 


<sub>Note: there is a ~100mV zone around the standard potential for an electrode process where the statistical equilibrium of electrons means that there are appreciable amounts of both reduced and oxidised species. </sub>
