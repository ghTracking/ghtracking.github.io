# Electrochemistry

## Why is electrochemistry important in analytical studies?

- Analyse a solution for the presence of metal ions.
- Investigate the redox behaviour of different species.
- Electrosynthesis.
- Generation of radicals or unstable ions for further analytic or spectroscopic investigation.


## What is the open-circuit potential (OCV)?

The OCV is the measured potentiala cross two electrodes when no current flows. An OCV cannot be defined when a redox couole cannot be defined.



If an electrode is made to be more negative, the energy level of the electrons increases. An electron is then likely to be lost to an MO of the electrolyte, meaning oxidation of the electrode takes place.

Bard and Faulkner. If the direction of electron flow is from the electrode to protons in solution, this is a _cathodic_ current flow.

## What is an ideal polarised electrode?

An electrode at which only non-Faradaic processes take place. That is, there are no current-inducing charge-transfer reactions by the bulk solution. No real electrode can behave like this over an entire potential range, but some electrodes demonstrate this behaviour over large potential ranges.
