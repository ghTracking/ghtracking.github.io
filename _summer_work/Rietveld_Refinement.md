## What is Rietveld refinement?



## What information can be gathered from Rietveld refinements? 



## What are stacking faults?



## What are the R-values used for assessment of Rietveld fit?

_Toby, B.H., 2006. R factors in Rietveld analysis: How good is good enough?. Powder diffraction, 21(1), pp.67-70._


## What is the spinel structure?





## Describe some of the strategies to change effects in diffraction patterns.

| Effect     | Change in model |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Peak position offset      | Sample height, zero-shift       |
| Wrong intensities   | Scale factor        |
| Wrong relative intensity | Preferred orientation, grainy sample, atomic coordinates, site occupanices, thermal displacement, grainy sample |
| Wrong peak width | Crystallite size, strain (micro), roughness, transparency |


## What is the Calgioti formula and where are its parameters useful in Rietveld refinements?

The formula is used to provide parameters for use in Gaussian and Lorentzian lineshapes for a Psuedo-Voigt function. These parameters dicatate the full-widths at half-maxima (FWHM) at different values of theta. 

## What affects intensity?

$$ I = SM_{K}L_{K}|F_{K}|^2P_{K}E_{K}$$

- S: scale factor
- M: multiplicity (i.e. (001) and (100) being the same within cubic)
- L: Lorentz polarisation factor
- P: preferred orientation
    - March distribution function
    - Spherical harmonics    
- E: extinction correction
- F: structure factor

The intensity will also feature a scale factor for each phase (the above equation is summed over all peaks)
