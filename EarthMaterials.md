### Sedimentary rock-forming minerals and materials

* Solid solution and aragonite stability diagram for calcite

### Formation, transport and lithification of sediment

* African plate collided with Eurasian at end of Mesozoic Era to form Alps.
* Immature, submature, mature, supermature
  * Progression for angular and poorly-sorted sediment to rounded and well-sorted
* Diagram of carbonate formation in proximity to a reef
* The calcite compensation depth signifies the point at which carbonates primarily dissolve into seawater. This is due to the fact that pressure increases and temperature decreases, favouring the conditions for dissolution. In the Pacific Ocean, the depth is ~1000m, whereas in the Atlantic it is ~5000m. This difference exists as the Pacific Ocean is older, meaning there is a greater amount of CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved at depth. 
* As radiolaria and diatoms secrete a silica test, which will not dissolve at depth, at the lowest regions of the ocean there is a siliceous ooze present.
* Gypsum and anhydrite are much more soluble than halite, meaning they precipitate first when forming evaporites. Yet, halite is likely to be in greater abundance in solution, but requires the correct conditions to precipitate. Halites will tend to deposit above the other minerals and there is a resulting layer formation. With rhythmic patterning in the layers representation annual precipitation, each layer is known as a varve.

* Sediment at the base of a glacial ice sheet is known as lodgement till. It tends to be highly compacted due to the weight of the overlying ice. Ablation till is the coarser fraction of sediment that was previously distributed throughout the ice sheet, as meltwater has washed away finer grained elements.
* The relationship defined by Stokes' Law states that the settling velocity of a grain particle in suspension is proportional to its diameter squared, meaning this factor is deemed to be most significant.
* Loess deposits are the finer grained fractions of sediment which are removed to combine in this separate formation.
* Transgressive deposits - formed by rising sea level
* Regressive deposits - formed by falling sea level
* Many continental chalk deposits were formed in epeiric seas, where sea level rose as mid ocean ridges were more active and increased in prominence to displace more water.
* Convergent plate boundary
  * Sedimentation rapid from short, high-energy rivers, leading to immaturity.
* Passive continental margin 
  * Slow rivers lead to maturity
  * Deltas may lead to further subsidence and sedimentation
* Rift and pull-apart basins
  * Erosion of scarp leads to alluvial fan
  * Rift basins lead to the deposition of conglomerate
  * Pull-apart basins permit lacustrine deposits of black shale

* Dolomite increase the porosity of a rock as its molar volume is 13% less.

### Sedimentary rock classification, occurrence and plate tectonic significance

* Clay particles settle on their (001) plane, leading to fissility of mudrock
* _Chattanooga Shale, United States_ - laterally extensive, formed in shallow epeiric seas.
* Breccia is the term used for congolmerates where grains are typically angular.
* Conglomerate with one clast type: oligomict; many clast types: polymict
* Cyanobacteria produce filamentous mats which are able to trap carbonates in curved, laminated layers - stromatolite
* Limestone formed in freshwater lakes forms interlayers with siliciclastic rocks. With more clay in its structure, the limestone is known as a marl. Limestone which forms near hot springs is known as a travertine. Circulation cells in water established by heating cause a pressure decrease at depth, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> exsolution.
* Coal ranks:
  * Lignite (brown coal)
  * Bituminous
  * Anthracite
  * Cannel coal - conchoidal fracture, greasy, more like oil shale
  * The low density of halite in relation to overlying rocks means that it forms a Rayleigh-Taylor instability and rises through the surrounding layers as domes.
