Quick summary:

# Book 1- periodicity and the elements


Emphasis on fact that one-electron solution to 
Schr√∂dinger equation ($$ E_n = \frac{-Z^2 R_H}{n^2})
can be modified to use '$$Z_{eff}$$', where
this is the nuclear charge minus a shielding
constant.

Scales of $$Z_{eff}$$:
- Clementi
    - Derived from orbital energy calculations
    - Amplify the observed trends 
- Slater
    - Based on screening of electrons
    - 1s electrons count for 0.35 when considering
    a 1s electron, other 'same n' count as 0.3 
    - Electrons in next lowest shell count 
    as 0.85 and electrons in (n-2) shells 
    count as 1.00.
    - For electrons in d or f, 1.00 is taken
    as the contribution for all other electrons.
    - d-orbitals do not shield each other well, 
    so $$Z_{eff}$$ increases across period (Z 
    will increase by 1, but shielding increases
    by only 0.35)

3d-orbitals become core-like and so do not
play a significant part in the chemistry
of the 4p-orbitals.

There is an increase in s-p orbital energy
separation as one moves across a period. 
s-orbital energy decreases faster. This is
due to the fact that s-orbitals penetrate
more effectively. The separation decreases 
when descending a group, as there are a 
greater number of nodes and greater 
penetrative effect for both types of 
orbitals. Alternatively, one could reason
to say that the amount of shielding increases.


4s energy does not change much across
transition metals. This is because the 
charge is screened effectively by the 
d-orbital shielding.

4s orbitals see significant energy drop from
Gallium onwards, as 4p orbitals do not
screen 4s effectively.

6s orbitals are lower in energy than 5s 
orbitals. The value of $Z_{eff}$ is
increased by relativistic effects, as the
mass of the electron increases.

6s also experience a reduction in their 
radius, which leads to a greater shielding 
effect. This therefore decreases $$Z_{eff}$$
for higher energy d and f orbitals, which
subsequently raises their energies (e.g. 
Au). 

(Discussion of atomic radii)

Ionic size depending on charge of ion, 
coordination number and oxidation state.

van der Waals radii defined as distance 
between two molecules where only dispersion 
forces are acting between them.

Small increase in atomic radii down Group 
13 is explaind by d-orbital contraction.

For period 6 TMs, relativistic contraction 
accounts for approx 20% of the overall 
reduction in size. The remainder is 
accounted for by f-block contraction,
which leads to the 4d and 5d TMs of a triad
being similar in size.

(Ionisation energy)

4p, 5p and 6p have higher ionisation 
energies than expected due to d-block 
contraction. Spikes in IE due to full or
half-full orbitals. 

O, F and Ne have lower ionisation energies
than expected...
lecture notes say due to exchange energy
orthocresol on stack exchange says due to pairing energy (Oxford PhD student in NMR - Jonathan Yong).

Sidenote: Boyd 1984. Fermi correlation means
that two parallel-spin electrons are less likely to be situated close to each other,
leading to less screening of nuclear charge 
and a greater $$V_{en}$$. Boyd demonstrates
through various calculations that $$V_{ee}$$
is in fact not lower in a high spin state
for He 1s2s, meaning the reason for its lower energy cannot be that electrons repel each other less. It is the greater $$Z_{eff}$$ (electron-nuclear attraction) which lowers the energy of the system.
