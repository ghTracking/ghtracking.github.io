# High Resolution Molecular Spectroscopy


## A good reminder - how do we convert between units?

Joules to Hz : divide by h \
Joules to cm$^{-1}$ : divide by 100ch \
Hz to cm$^{-1}$ : divide by 2 $\pi \tilde{c}$

(use the equations. e.g. $E/h = \nu$)

Population $\propto (2J+1)exp(-E_J/kT)$

## Why is spontaneous emission required as a process to explain equilibrium?

According to theory, $B_{ij}$ = $B_{ji}$ when the degeneracies of each level are the same. According to the equation for the rate of change of particles at level t, this would suggest that $n_i = nj$, which is not the case according to the Boltzmann distribution.

## Outline the three types of linewidth broadening






## Explain the Stark effect

- Molecule rotating about axis with angulular momentum quantum number **J** ($\sqrt{J(J+1)}\hbar$). Projected onto the a axis is number **K**. 
- Dipole precesses around **J**. Only component of dipole parallel to **J** survives.
- $\alpha$ is angle between **J** and $\mu$. $\beta$ is angle between E and **J**.
- $\mu_J = \mu \cdot cos(\alpha)$
- $cos(\alpha) = \frac{K}{\sqrt{KJ(J+1)}\hbar}$
- $E_{Stark} = - \mu_JE cos(\beta)$
- $cos(\beta) = \frac{M_J}{\sqrt{J(J+1)}\hbar}$

## How does Raman spectroscopy work?

Incident photons interact with molecule. Light emerges in all directions from sample as it is 'scattered'. When the emergent light has a different frequency to the original light, this is Raman scattering.

### Semi-classical description.
Electric field of laser light distorts electron density of molecule. Produces induced dipole, which relies on the anisotropy of the molecule. 

induced dipole $= \alpha\cdot E_{field} \cdot sin (\omega_L t)$

$\alpha = \alpha(0) + \alpha(1)sin(2 \omega_r t)$

where $\omega_R$ is the angular speed of rotation.


### Why do molecular vibrations give rise to Raman scattering?
Vibration involves change in electron density of molecule. 

## What is the use of the depolarisation ratio?

$\rho = \frac{IâˆŸ}{I //}$

$0 \leq \rho \leq \frac{3}{4}$

Totally symmetric modes close to zero value. These are known as *polarised* bands.





## Short notes on Raman
Near-IR light used so that it is not absorbed by molecules.

Change in frequency is negative for Stokes lines.

As J increases in the S-branch, the amount of energy absorbed becomes greater. Hence, the measured wavenumber becomes smaller.

I expect spacing between rotational levels to decrease with higher $\nu$, as greater vibration leads to greater bond length and $B \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$ 

For a Stokes line in rot-vib, the laser light will 'lose' the energy corresponding to the frequency of the pure vibrational transition, and the frequency corresponding to the increase in rotational level.


## Important note on Franck-Condon

If the ground state (or lower energy) PE curve has a smaller $r_e$, transitions to a greater number of $\nu$ states are possible, but with a low intensity. However, due to the shallow nature of PE curves at greater separation, if the ground state PE curve has a greater $r_e$ value, possible $\nu$ states are lower, although the Franck-Condon factor will be higher for the particular state that aligns nicely. 


## Rot/vib/elec spectra

Higher value of B -> lower value of r. If $\Delta$B >0, the higher state has a shorter bond length. The band-head is in the P-branch. \
If $\Delta$B <0, the higher state has a greater bond length. Given the maths of the equations, the band-head is in the R-branch. 


## Contrast the strong- and weak-field approaches to TM electronic spectroscopy.

Strong field - dominant interaction is between ligands and metal \
Weak field - dominant interaction is electron-electron repulsion. Interaction with ligands is only small perturbation.
