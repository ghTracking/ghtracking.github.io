## What are Wade's rules?

## Define isovalent, isoelectronic and isolobal.

## What is the v+x-12 rule
v is number of valence electrons\
x is number of electrons available from ligand\
-12 is subtracting electrons from the six unavailable orbitals - 3 orbitals low-lying, 3 involved to bond to ligands

## Electron counting for carboranes

## Which are the kinetic and thermodynamic isomers for carboranes?

# The Heavier Transition Metals
- Metal-metal multiple bonding

## Why are 2nd and 3rd row metal complexes largely diamagnetic?

- Cluster shapes 


- Bond order 

## Why is the 3rd IE so high for transition metals?
f-orbitals are poor at shielding, meaning s-orbitals feel greater nuclear charge than expected.


## Proof of the $$\delta$$ bond?
Staggered conformation of ligands minimises repulsion, but in presence of $$\Delta$$ bond they are more likely to be eclipsed to improve overlap.

## Are metal complexes with axial ligands stronger or weaker? Why?
Weaker, as some of the e- density is donated into the $$\delta$$ antibonding orbital.



## Other types of M-M bonding

## M-L bonding

## Pt chain compounds



# The f-block: Lanthanoids and actinoids

## Describe the key points relating to the bonding of lanthanoids and actinoids.
4f-orbitals of lanthanoids are relatively contracted and do not contribute to bonding.\
Early Ac: 5f-orbitals more expanded, as 7s-orbitals are lowered in energy due to relativistic effects. Hence, able to partake in covalent bonding,\
Late Ac: tendency to partake in ionic interactions\

Low ox-state Ln have more expanded 4f and so may covalently bond. 

## Why are 6s filled ahead of 4f and 5d?
Diffuse orbitals. More repulsion in f.

## Draw the boundary surfaces for the f-orbitals. 

## Describe how the f-block elements may be separated and isolated.

## Describe the organometallics of the lanthanoids.

## Describe the covalent bonding of actinoids.
