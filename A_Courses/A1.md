## What are Wade's rules?

## Define isovalent, isoelectronic and isolobal.

## What is the v+x-12 rule
v is number of valence electrons\
x is number of electrons available from ligand\
-12 is subtracting electrons from the six unavailable orbitals - 3 orbitals low-lying, 3 involved to bond to ligands

## Electron counting for carboranes

## Which are the kinetic and thermodynamic isomers for carboranes?

# The Heavier Transition Metals
- Metal-metal multiple bonding

## Why are 2nd and 3rd row metal complexes largely diamagnetic?

- Cluster shapes 


- Bond order 

## Why is the 3rd IE so high for transition metals?
f-orbitals are poor at shielding, meaning s-orbitals feel greater nuclear charge than expected.


## Proof of the $$\delta$$ bond?
Staggered conformation of ligands minimises repulsion, but in presence of $$\Delta$$ bond they are more likely to be eclipsed to improve overlap.

## Are metal complexes with axial ligands stronger or weaker? Why?
Weaker, as some of the e- density is donated into the $$\delta$$ antibonding orbital.



## Other types of M-M bonding

## M-L bonding

## Pt chain compounds



# The f-block: Lanthanoids and actinoids

## Describe the key points relating to the bonding of lanthanoids and actinoids.
4f-orbitals of lanthanoids are relatively contracted and do not contribute to bonding.\
Early Ac: 5f-orbitals more expanded, as 7s-orbitals are lowered in energy due to relativistic effects. Hence, able to partake in covalent bonding,\
Late Ac: tendency to partake in ionic interactions\

Low ox-state Ln have more expanded 4f and so may covalently bond. 

## Why are 6s filled ahead of 4f and 5d?
Diffuse orbitals. More repulsion in f.

## Draw the boundary surfaces for the f-orbitals. 
Remember there are two sets: a general and a cubic.


General: like cubic described below, but the $$\pm 1$$ and $$\pm 3$$ cases have 3 nodal planes to make a 'hexagon' in terms of angles between planes (60$$\degrees$$).

Cubic: $$m_l$$ = $$\pm$$3 looks like z$$^2$$ with extra ring (so does $$m_l$$=0). Others look like xz/yz/xz with extra nodal plane across plane. 

## What is significant about the f-block ionic solids?
Lattice energy estimated using Kapustinskii equation.

(III) ox state most stable.

## Describe how the f-block elements may be separated and isolated.
Redox chemistry separates Ce and Eu.

Froth flotation concentrates lanthanoids from ore.

Liquid-liquid extraction purifies them.

Acidification removes Th.

Ion exchange chromatography separates metals.

Electrolysis of molten halides purifies them. 

## Describe the organometallics of the lanthanoids.
Largely ionic. 

Anhydrous LnCl$$_3$$ reacts with Grignard or alkyllithium reagents.

XRD suggests that the metals bond to O-donor solvents (which may be removed by sublimation).

The Ln alkyls are very reactive and the chlorides are regenerated when reacting with a TM chloride such as FeCl$$_3$$.


## Describe the covalent bonding of actinoids.

UO$$_2^{2+}$$ - orbitals involved:
5f, 6d, 5f and 6d.
z$$^2$$ and yz/xz-type orbitals
