If we consider a molecule such as Li-F, at the equilibrium distance it is described by an ionic wavefunction, representing Li$^+$F$^-$. However, at great distances, it will be described by a covalent interaction, as the bond breaks homolytically in the gas phase. In the adiabatic approximation, there is an 'avoided crossing' at the point at which the wavefunction becomes more covalent than ionic in nature, meaning the symmetry of the wavefunctions leads to a separation in their energies and they do not cross. Hence, at this distance, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is not particularly accurate.
