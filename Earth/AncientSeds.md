- Some details also taken from Sedimentology and Stratigraphy, Nicols 
 
### General

* Wind abrasian is more effective than water abrasion as there is no surface to 'cushion' collisions as there is within water, due to air's lower density.
* Glauconite appears to be indicative of a marine environment (authigenic mineral from early diagenesis). This is due to the fact that it does not persist when perturbed, as it is so unstable.
* Marine muds may contain 40ppm more boron than freshwater environments
* Pre-depositional
  * Channels, scour marks
*Syn-depositional
  * Micro-laminations, cross-bedding
      * Dependent on viscosity, temperature, velocity ...
* Post-depositional
  * Load-casts/flame structures (vertical)
    * Possible causes: turbulence, connate fluids, earthquakes
  * Sliding/slumping (horizontal)
* Ichnofacies - suite of sedimentary rocks within which characteristic trace fossils are expected to occur.
* Cycle-generating processes:
  * Autocyclic mechanism
    * Occur as a result of mode of sediment deposition, e.g. channel migration/diversion
  * Allocyclic mechanism
    * Occur as a result of other external processes such as subsidence and tectonic uplift
* Geophysical logs:
  * Density
  * Porosity
  * Sonic velocity
  * Spontaneous potential
  * Radioactivity
    * These features can be correlated with other lithological intervals, but may be limited by diagenetic history following deposition.

### River deposits

* Thalweg - line connecting the deepest parts of a river
* Meandering river:
  * Recent : Mississippi
  * Sub-facies:
    * Flood-plain
    * Channel
    * Abandoned channel
* Braided river
  * Graded bedding not laterally extensive (rapid switching, sudden infilling)
  * Haphazard sub-facies
  * Ancient example: Torridon Group
    * Basal facies: angular, poorly sorted - piedmont fan
    * Grey facies: interlayered sandstones and shales, but some evidence of high energy environment - Park et al (2003): lacustrine turbite sequence
    * Red facies: coarse grained, low paleocurrent variability - braided channel complexes 
  

### Wind-blown

* Process of winnowing: removal of finer grains from sediment in flow - more effective in air
* Distinguished from water-deposits from statistical analysis of sorting and ripple size. Sedimentary features such as barchan and seif dunes are uncommon (if at all) as sub-aqueous features.
* Aeolian environments also unlikely to have vegetative cover or extensive fossil record by virtue of the arid environment in which sediment is deposited. Thus, as well as lack of direct observation, sand flux is affected to a greater extent in sub-aqueous facies.
* Aeolian environments may also display a lack of cyclicity in bedding. This is due to the fact that fluvial facies show evidence of repetition and predictability more prominently due to consistency in flow. Wind has a more sensitive dependence on initial conditions, given the variety within the surroundings, meaning sediments do not form as many distinctive cyclic features consistently.
* Notable example of loess: Iowa's Loess Hills


### Lake deposits

* Low energy, no marine fauna
* Cyclicity due to factors such as drying out in ephermal lakes
* Often find monospecific assemblages of stenohaline organisms

### Deltas

* River dominated
  * e.g. Mississippi
  * 
* Tide dominated
  * e.g. Ganges
  * Difficult to characterise due to inevitable fluvial influence
  * Heterolithic sequence 
* Wave dominated
  * e.g. Nile
  * Sand deposited and shifted to form barrier islands at edge of lagoon at delta periphery
  <br>
  General example:<br>
  * Yoredale Series - upward coarsening cyclothem sequences
    * Coals and rootlet beds - swamp
    * Cross-bedded sands - alluvial distributary channel
    * Rippled sands - delta platform (subaqueous)
    * Laminated silts - prodelta
    * Limestones - marine
    
  

### Linear clastic shorelines



### Mixed clastic: carbonate shorelines



### Shelf deposits: carbonate and terrigenous



### Reefs

* Permian rocks of West Texas well-documented (Guadalupe mountains) over past Century
* Fringing, barrier, atoll
* Fringing arises as a result of lack of rainfall to prevent organism growth
* Backreef lagoon, reef flat, fore-reef
* Submarine cliff with talus slope at start of fore-reef

### Flysch and turbidites



### Pelagic deposits
