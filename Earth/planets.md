Mayor and Queloz 1995
  - transit method to detection variation in radial velocity. Detection of Jupiter sized object orbiting

Barnes 1982
  - provided a collection of research into stellar nucleosynthesis (e.g. evolution within stars, discussion of the r- and s-processes and the nature of supernovae).

Bromiley 2018
  - percolation and timescale for planetary differentiation: no need for magma oceans? Yet, must also reconcile with predicts of noble gas models and isotopic ratios of light elements such as helium, as noted by...
Ballentine 2002
  - insight into noble gas ratios within the mantle and predictions of atmospheric evolution. More research required into sub-continental isotopes to contrain elemental compositions further.
  
Allegre 1983
  - Volcanic rocks contain a higher proportion of Xe-129. Hence, elements must have degassed relatively soon in the history of the Earth over the geological time scale (30Ma). This agrees with Hf-W isotope ratios. Tungsten is a siderophilic element and is present in high amounts in the mantle. Thus, knowing the half-life of Hf, it can be deduced that not all of this can have decayed before core differentiation occurred.

Collaborative work, 2017
  - Terrestrial planets around ultracool dwarf TRAPPIST-1
  
Kopparapu et Ramirez 2013
  - New predictions on extent of habitable zones limit the instances that the JWST should target
  
Rothman et al 2010
  - Importance of establishing spectral databases to probe the solar system for evidence of trace elements and indications of the nature of processes that occur.

Wilson et al 2010
  - microbe transfer from Mars to Earth viable, with opposite route less so. This is dependent on travel time and exposure to gamma ray radiation, influencing survivability rates. Keeping in mind that Mars cooled before Earth.
  LITHOPANSPERMIA - transfer of organisms in rock from one planet to another

  Villanueva 2015
    Estimated ~140m depth
    IR mapping
    Greater sampling (such as from Atmospheric and Volatile Evolution Mission) would constrain spatial and time-based uncertainties.

  Geological processes occurred at a greater rate as a consequence of rapid mantle convection.
  Zircon thermometer for melting conditions
  Interesting to contrast to NASA research reported in January 2019 which suggested the presence of a Hadean Earth rock on the moon.

Seager 2013
  - No universal habitable zone
  - Ground liquid water crucial
  - Must search for more biosignature gases as indicators
