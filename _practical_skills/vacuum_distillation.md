## Vacuum distillation

<div class="tip">
- Use a nomograph to calculate boiling points at different pressures (such as by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation)

</div>

## Fractional distillation

- Begin to collect the first fraction when the temperature stops rising. When it begins to rise again, prepare the pig to collect the next fraction.

## Strength of vacuum pumps

### Low strength (20-50 mmHg [=27-67 bar])

- Sufficient for rotary evaporation of most solvents
- Typically `house vacuum'


### Medium strength (10-12 mmHg [=13-16 bar])

- Water aspirator
- Can suck back if water pressure suddenly drops. Do not turn off the tap during use!

- Oil-free electric diaphragm pump. 

### High strength (<0.1 mmHg [=0.13 mbar])

- _Rotary oil pump_
- Requires solvent trap to prevent contamination of pump oil
- Ideally use double condenser system of CO<sub>2</sub>/acetone and liquid nitrogen. 
- When turning off, first close 2-way tap between traps and appratus. Then use three-way tap between traps and pump to vent through pump, then turn off pump. Remove liquid nitrogen as soon as pump turned off, then vent traps. 

- Oil should be changed once a month for pump used every day?

- _Mercury or oil vapour pump_
    - Gives 10<sup>-5<sup>[=1.3Ã—10<sup>-4</sup> mbar]
