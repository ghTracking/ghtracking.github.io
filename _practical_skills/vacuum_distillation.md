## Vacuum distillation

<div class="tip">
- Use a nomograph to calculate boiling points at different pressures (such as by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation)

</div>

## Fractional distillation

- Begin to collect the first fraction when the temperature stops rising. When it begins to rise again, prepare the pig to collect the next fraction.
