## Flash column
_From University Laboratory Manual_

- Broadly, for 1g of compound, 4 cm diameter silica and 10 cm height. 
- Rf should be ~0.3 for desired compound. 

- Slurry silica. Open tap. 
- Pour into column. Tap column lightly to ensure packing. 
- Use bellows to push solvent level down to top of silica. Close tap. 
- Pipette solution with dissolved compound into top of column
- Rinse flask with solvent system and wash into column. Use bellows again to push solvent level down to top of silica
- Add ~2 cm of sand to top of column
- Fill remainder of column with solvent system.
- Use bellows to push solvent through

- Avoid using magnetic stirrer bar for silica stirring

### Dry-loading
If the compound has poor solubility but TLC shows that it is still suitable in the solvent system, dry-loading should be used.
- Add 2-5 times silica compared to the sample to the solution of sample. The silica used should be 5-10 % of total silica (reachdevices.com)
- Swirl to ensure silica is suspended, then rotary evaporate to leave the solid. 
- Add silica containing sample to top of column.
- Once this is done, add sand and run as normal. 

## Flushing through

- reachdevices.com recommends 2 to 4 psi gas pressure for 20-45 $\mu$ m silica and 1 to 2 psi for 40-75 $\mu$ m silica
