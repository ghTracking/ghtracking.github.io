Let's talk about the Hessian.

What is it?

The Hessian is a matrix of second derivatives

_Sidenote_:
- HÃ¼ckel theory applies the variational method to a linear combination of atomic orbitals, using assumptions about the resonance, overlap and coulomb integrals.
- Neither the form of the Hamiltonian, nor the integrals, is required.
