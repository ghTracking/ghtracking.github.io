### Skim of some chapters and pages

p.67 the r-process describes the process of heavy-element formation, likely in supernovae events. Neutron capture to saturation to beta decay. Rapid. Indicative vertically hachured lines seen on N-Z graph. Barnes et al (1982) explore and provide analysis into stellar nucleosynthesis.

p. 127 Widmanstätten patterns from iron meteorites provide insight into the nature of the internal consituents and structure of planetesimals.

p. 129 Solar system formation: <br>
  * Solar nebula contracts and flattens into spinning disk <br>
  * Rock and metal will condense in the inner solar system, with rock, metal and ices condensing in the outer solar system. <br>
  * Planetesimals accrete, before impacts form larger planets. <br>
  * T-Tauri phases of Sun create solar winds which ejecs gas from between the planets (point at which nuclear fusion is able to occur). Outer planets are capable of sustaining a vast atmosphere including He and H<sub>2</sub> <br>
    * The nature of these winds was investigated by Lizano et al (1988)

p. 164 <sup>26</sup>Al : half life of 0.73 million years. Hence, sensitive within first 10 million years following its formation. Its presence would indicate that a supernova event must have occured with 5-10Ma of the rock's formation. 
  Wasserburg (1976) used the Allende meteorite to show that the <sup>26</sup>Mg was higher in the sample than in other Earth rocks.
  
  If a rock features a high amount of aluminium and a low amount of magnesium, it would be an important candidate for investigation. The initial aluminium would have been both 26 and 24 forms, meaning that <sup>26</sup>Mg would have formed.
  Controversy arose over the interpretation of results. Nevertheless, there was a general consensus that the solar system must have formed from a huge cloud of interstellar gas
  
p. 193 evidence for heterogeneous accretion: tungsten, a siderophilic element, is present in high ratios in the mantle. Thus, all of <sup>182</sup>Hf cannot have decayed before core differentiation occurred.
 
p. 195 melting - return when/if looking at igneous 
 
Bromiley et al (2018) - the timescale of percolative flow suggests that may have been imperative in deriving the core of the Earth
 
p. 206 Investigation by Allègre (1983) showed that volcanic rocks feature an excess of the Xe-129 isotope. From this, we may posit that the atmosphere must have formed early in the Earth's history. This is due to the fact that one would expect a greater proportion of other Xe isotopes to be present in the mantle if the xenon had not moved to the atmosphere. A timescale constraint gives a figure of around 30 Ma after its accretion, similar to Hf-W predictions.
 
p. 219 Lunar Maria (areas of basalt floods) are younger than the Lunar Highlands, as evidenced from inspection of craters.
   
p. 224 stishovite, a high-pressure form of quartz, provides evidence for impacts in craters that are non-volcanic
  
p. 233 the 2+ valence state that Europium is capable of forming means that it can be used to investigate the history of rocks on the moon. The Highlands have a positive anomaly. Eu<sup>2+</sup> has had the opportunity to substitute into the structure of plagioclase feldspar, which must compose the rock.

p. 240 The limited pressure stability of anorthite means that Earth would not have been capable of forming a thick anorthisitic crust, unlike the moon.

p. 247 A late, heavy bombardment occured 800 Ma after the formation of the Earth. This is the age of the oldest rocks on Earth, suggesting it was the beginning of a period of stability.
