# Chapter 1: In the Beginning?

* Kotuikan River shields 20 million years of Cambrian history through the succession of formations present

# Chapter 2 The Tree of Life

# Chapter 3 Life's signature in ancient rocks

* Spitsbergen sedimentary rocks are 600-800 million years old.
* Akademikerbreen Group
  * Black chert nodules provide evidence for microfossils
  * Carbonates display wavy laminations representative of stromatolites
  
Aside : Rhynie Chert
  * 400 Ma sinter deposit
  * Preserves plants in situ and often in growth position
  * Provides evidence for phylogenic adaptations with regard to osmotic and chemical pressures, as well as the extent to which some of these sporophytic plants were endemic.

* Organic matter in photosynthetic organisms contains less $^{13}C$ in comparison with surrounding sediments, causing fractionation and known as the kinetic isotope effect.
* Similarly, biological sulfate reduction shows a preference for $^{32}S$. Consequently, the sedimentary record may show a greater abundance of this isotope. This is due to the fact that the sulfate atoms are converted to hydrogen sulfide, which then reacts to form pyrite and enters the sedimentary record.
